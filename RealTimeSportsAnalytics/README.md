# Real-Time Sports Analytics System

## Overview
The Real-Time Sports Analytics System is a Python-based application designed to analyze real-time sports data and provide insights into athlete performance. The system collects data such as speed, distance, and heart rate, analyzes it, and visualizes the results using graphs. This project serves as a foundation for building more complex sports analytics applications.

## Features
- **Data Collection**: Simulates data collection from sensors, including speed, distance, and heart rate.
- **Performance Analysis**: Calculates a performance score based on collected metrics.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualizes performance metrics using Matplotlib for easy interpretation.
- **Modular Design**: The code is organized into separate modules for data collection, analysis, and visualization, making it easy to extend and maintain.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The primary programming language used for the application.
- **Matplotlib**: A plotting library used for visualizing data.
- **Random**: Used to simulate data collection.
